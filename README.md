# Learning week 2018 â€“ Functional programming

In this exercise JD already started implementing a validator system for
HTML form input fields. In the middle he recognized that it could be
better to try it with a more functional approach instead of just testing
and updating each input field separately. In the comments you find the
calls he'd like to make.
